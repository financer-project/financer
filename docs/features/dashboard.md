# Dashboard & Analytics

The **Dashboard** is the central overview page that provides visual insights into your financial data. It aggregates transaction data into meaningful metrics and charts.

## KPI Metrics

The dashboard displays key performance indicators at the top:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Balance** | Current total balance across all accounts in the household |
| **Income** | Total income for the selected period |
| **Expenses** | Total expenses for the selected period |
| **Transaction Count** | Number of transactions in the selected period |

Each KPI includes a **trend indicator** showing how the current period compares to the previous period, so you can quickly see if spending is increasing or decreasing.

## Balance History

A line chart shows how your total balance has changed over time. This helps you identify:

- Overall financial trajectory (growing or shrinking savings)
- Periods of high spending
- Impact of large income or expense events

## Category Distribution

A breakdown chart shows how your expenses (or income) are distributed across categories. This answers questions like:

- What percentage of spending goes to housing vs. food?
- Which expense categories are the largest?
- How does income break down by source?

## Analytics Scope

All dashboard data is scoped to the currently selected household. If you belong to multiple households, switch between them to see analytics for each.
