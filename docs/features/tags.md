# Tags

**Tags** provide a flexible, cross-cutting labeling system for transactions. While categories provide a single hierarchical classification, tags allow you to add multiple labels to any transaction.

## Why Tags?

Categories are great for answering "what type of expense is this?" but sometimes you need additional dimensions. Tags answer questions like:

- **Project-based**: Tag transactions related to a specific project (e.g., "Home Renovation", "Vacation 2025")
- **Status-based**: Mark transactions as "Reimbursable" or "Tax Deductible"
- **Recurring**: Tag regular expenses like "Subscription" or "Monthly"
- **Shared**: Mark expenses that are "Split with Partner"

A single transaction can have multiple tags, and a single tag can be applied to many transactions (many-to-many relationship).

## Tag Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Name | Display name of the tag |
| Description | Optional description of what the tag represents |
| Color | Optional color for visual identification |

## Scope

Like all entities in Financer, tags belong to a household. Each household has its own independent set of tags.

## Tags vs. Categories

| Aspect | Categories | Tags |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Per transaction | One category | Multiple tags |
| Structure | Hierarchical (parent/child) | Flat |
| Budget tracking | Yes | No |
| Type-restricted | Yes (Income or Expense) | No |
| Best for | Primary classification | Cross-cutting concerns |

Use categories for your primary financial classification and tags for any additional dimensions you want to track.
